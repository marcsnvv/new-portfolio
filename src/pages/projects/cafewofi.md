Cafewofi comes from the 3 words "Cafe, Work, Finder" but to make a shorter name, I chose cafewofi. But now, what is cafewofi? Cafewofi is a platform born from my personal experience and understanding of what it takes to work remotely while traveling. Itâ€™s a space for digital nomads to find the best cafes to work from, wherever they are in the world. Our goal is simple: to help you find the perfect spot where you can be productive, connect with others, and enjoy a great cup of coffee.
