I learned to program when I was 14 and sold my first SaaS at 16. I specialized in web monitoring and automation with Python, but I've worked in all fields of development: websites, dashboards, e-commerce, mobile apps, APIs, databases, among many other things.
I define myself as a decisive and direct person; I like to work with clear and concise objectives.
